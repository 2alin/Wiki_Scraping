# Wiki_Scraping
Initially the project is basic Web Scaraping using Python Language. <br>
In this project we are scrapping basic data of different colleges or schools as per the users need from wikipedia.<br>
Default settings of web page : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology <br>

Committed code is scrapping the Motto of MIT. Later on we can enhance the code in such a way that it may be able to fetch any data from 
wikipedia of any college, school or organizations as per user need.
